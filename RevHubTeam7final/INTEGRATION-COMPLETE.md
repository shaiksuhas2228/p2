## How to Use This UI

### Option 1: Copy the Complete Dashboard
Copy the dashboard component from `fee/foo/src/app/dashboard.component.ts` and its CSS to your shell-app.

### Option 2: Use as Reference
Use the fee/foo folder as a reference to enhance your existing components with the same styling and features.

### Key Files to Reference
- `dashboard.component.ts` - Main dashboard logic

- `core/services/` - All service implementations

## Next Steps

1. **Copy Services**: Copy all services from `fee/foo/src/app/core/services/` to your shell-app
2. **Copy Dashboard**: Replace your current components with the dashboard component
3. **Update Routes**: Update routing to use the new dashboard
4. **Test**: Run and test all features

The fee/foo folder contains everything you need for a complete, modern social media application UI!
